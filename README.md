This is an experimental [Den](http://wiki.xxiivv.com/den) implementation.

### Installation

1. `make`
1. Thats it. You should now have a `lair` binary.

### Documentation

Documentation is done with [Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/).
Note that this is for Lair itself, not for Den.

To build docs:

```bash
doxygen lair.conf
```
